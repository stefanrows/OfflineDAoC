# Tasks and Ideas

Capture rapid-fire tasks, feature requests, and ideas here. Include the desired outcome, scope, and any constraints or acceptance checks that are known; leave unknown details explicit rather than inventing requirements. Recording an idea does not authorize implementing the backlog. Bugs belong in [BUGS.md](BUGS.md).

When a task is done and its required verification is complete, move it out of its current section into **Finished** immediately, mark it **Done**, and record a brief result and completion version (or date for tracking-only work). Do not leave completed items in **Open**. If implementation still awaits installation or real-client verification, keep it under **Implemented in source; installation verification pending**, recording the implementation version and outstanding checks, until those checks are complete. Preserve completed entries as history.

## Open

6. **Check XP and Realm Point rewards for `/companions` group members.** Verify
   whether companions receive the same XP and Realm Points as their player for
   PvP kills, and explain any differences in reward distribution. Observation:
   after two PvP kills, the player was level 17 while companions were level 13;
   everyone started at level 1.

## Implemented in source; installation verification pending

9. **Frontier PvE incentives and NPC-held keeps/relics.** Source version 0.72.0 adds +50% base monster XP in Old Frontiers/DF, on top of the configured rate; restores a manifest of 4,851 archived frontier spawns; and adds stationary Frontier Wardens garrisons, lord-unlocked claim stewards, 25 base guard RP and 1,500 base capture RP (30-minute reward cooldown per keep). Autonomous crews explicitly claim for their guild using native permissions and group checks. Fresh/reset worlds use NPC ownership; captured territory persists across restarts and existing guild claims are preserved. Server, launcher and Setup build verification are recorded in [FRONTIER_CAMPAIGN.md](FRONTIER_CAMPAIGN.md). Installation, backed-up spawn migration, world density/navigation, human/crew capture, rewards, restart persistence and relic raids await owner verification.

1. **Private Tailscale co-op between two home installations.** The launcher now
   has a client-only Join Friend shortcut with a Tailscale IPv4 login-port check,
   separate host and guest account names, and remote-session diagnostics. Source
   version: 0.60.0. Still needs host-side private network setup and the real
   two-home login, region transition, group, reconnect, save persistence, and
   reversed-host checks in [TAILSCALE_COOP.md](TAILSCALE_COOP.md).

2. **Autonomous dungeon activity, Darkness Falls and Camlann PvP behavior.** Implemented in source 0.61.0 after the owner's explicit DF implementation approval. DF now has a bounded entrance-stair repair, 1,417 proved spawn destinations and extra weight within the dungeon share. Hunters can patrol dungeons; ordinary pickup groups can choose connected dungeon camps. PvE aggression bypasses, patrol dwell timing and misleading RvR launcher labels are corrected. Awaiting installation, all-entrance client traversal and live PvE/PvP balance checks in [CAMLANN_PVP_REVIEW.md](CAMLANN_PVP_REVIEW.md).

3. **Population slider and Danger tooltips.** Expanded in source 0.62.0: all six type labels, sliders and percentage inputs explain the behavior, relevant levels and the effect on new versus existing bots; Danger explains its effect on existing Hunters after a restart. Source 0.70.0 further distinguishes saving new-bot weights from applying a live mix to the saved roster. Installation and launcher hover verification pending.

4. **Focus staff selection for casters.** Source 0.65.0 ranks earned and owned staves by the focus levels covering learned spell lines, including all-lines focus, before general item value. Installation and real-client inspection of caster loadouts and power use remain pending.

5. **Realm Points in Active Population.** Source version 0.67.0 adds a sortable Realm Points column using live points for active autonomous bots and saved points otherwise. Companions without a Realm Points record show a dash. Launcher display and live point updates await installation verification.

6. **Active Groups for large populations.** Source version 0.68.0 replaces the per-group card stack with a sortable, realm-filterable table. Search covers group, bot, class, zone, and task details; selecting a row shows member roles, locations, and live timers. Launcher installation and inspection with a large list (including the reported 82-group case) remain pending.

7. **Bard songs useful during combat.** Source version 0.69.0 keeps grouped Bards with an endurance song on their instrument during combat, preserves the endurance pulse, and lets them use the existing group-support actions. Mana and speed songs resume after combat; solo Bard behavior is unchanged. Installation and real-client verification of endurance upkeep alongside healing and control remain pending.

8. **Apply population-type changes to existing bots live.** Source version 0.70.0 adds a launcher action and server request/status flow for the entire non-retired saved autonomous roster, including offline bots. Player-led companions and temporary helpers are excluded. Offline changes run in bounded batches; active changes wait for safe task or group boundaries. The server saves the requested mix and bot types, and reports pending/applied/failed status. Installation and live acceptance remain pending: verify counts converge, active groups stay intact, repeated application is stable, and settings plus character progress survive restart.

## Finished

1. **Done — Review current Camlann bot setup and running-session activity** (2026-09-25). Confirmed the PvP ruleset, inspected type/charter meaning, sampled 600 active bots and recorded combat/activity aggregates without changing the running installation. Findings and offline navigation evidence are in [CAMLANN_PVP_REVIEW.md](CAMLANN_PVP_REVIEW.md). Implementation acceptance remains in the pending item above; camp-travel expirations remain in the bug tracker.
